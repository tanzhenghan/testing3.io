  <h2>Beginnings</h2>
  <p> <u> Introduction to the Game </u> </p>
  <p> I was introduced to the game of golf by my dad. He taught me everything about the game, ranging from the rules to the techniques involved. </p>
  <p> Every beginner would start off at the driving range, and that was what we did. We frequented the nearby <b>Champions Golf Driving Range</b>, and that was where he taught me the basics of the game. </p>
  <hr>
  <p> <u> My 1st Round of Golf </u> </p>
  <p> After numerous rounds of practices at the driving range, I played my 1st round of golf at <b>Royal Tanglin Golf Course</b>. It was suited for beginners because it was purely a Par 3 course (i.e. a short course). </p>
  <hr>
  <p> <u> Subsequent Rounds of Golf </u> </p>
  <p> As I slowly improved my playing abilities, my 2nd round of golf was played at <b>Mandai Executive Golf Course</b>, which was also suited for beginners because it was a relatively short course too. </p>
  <p> Due to the high cost of playing in golf courses in Singapore, as a family, we travelled overseas to play. My 1st overseas golf game was played in <b>Bintan Island, Indonesia </b>. Unlike the previous beginner courses I played in Singapore, the golf course at Bintan Island was better maintained; which enabled me to play a better game. Also, as the golf course was near the sea, the view I had while playing was truly breathtaking, and it is one I remember up till this day. </p>
