<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p> <u> Asian Tour</u> </p>
<p> Once I turn 25, I plan to turn professional and compete in the Asian Tour.</p>
<p><i> Just kidding, I am nowhere close to being able to play professionally. Who am I to kid? Haha </i></p>
<hr>
<p> <u> More Family Time </u></p>
<p> I plan on playing recreational golf more regularly with my family in the near future. As my dad gets on in years, <i>perhaps it is time</i> for me to plan and bring him on a golf outing like how he used to bring him when I was younger. I am looking forward to making new memories with my dad, and I am sure the (old and new) memories will last forever. <p>
