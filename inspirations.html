  <a class="anchor" id="C1"></a> <h3> 1) Tiger Woods </h3>
  <p><u> His achievements </u></p>
  <p> Tiger Woods is my biggest inspiration in Golf. He is said to be one of the greatest, if not <i>the</i> greatest, golfer of all time. 
  He has won 82 events on the PGA Tour (tied 1st) and of which, 15 were major championships (all-time 2nd highest). <br><br>
  <u> His qualities </u> <br><br>
  I admire his work ethic, confidence, and his ability to execute difficult shots and perform under tremendous pressure. <br><br>
  <i>Here is a video of one of his greatest shots, at the 2005 Masters Tournament.</i><br><br>

  <a class="anchor" id="C2"></a> <h3> 2) Mardan Mamat </h3>
  <p><u> His achievements </u></p>
  <p> Another of my inspirations in golf is Mardan Mamat, Singapore's No. 1 golfer for more than 10 years. He was the 1st player from Singapore to win a European Tour event and to play in The Open Championship, one of the major championships in golf.<br><br>
  He came from humble beginnings, and he initially worked as a caddie in a golf club. He would hone his golf game when he had no caddie duties.<br><br>
  <u> His qualities </u> <br><br>
  He is said to be a down-to-earth sportsman, and I admire his work ethic, and his perseverance in performing well in a sport, that not many people play and succeed in Singapore.<br><br>
  <i> Here is a picture of him winning the 2015 Bangladesh Open.</i></p>
