<h2>The Process</h2>

<p> Golf is an incredibly enjoyable game. Occasionally, or perhaps even regularly, it is also extremely frustrating, because the tolerance of error in a golf shot is very low. Even though one may spend hours practising, the results might not show. That being said, I do enjoy the game of golf, and I will list the <b>reasons why I enjoy golf</b> below. </p>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li><b>Family Time</b></li>
  <p> I play golf with my family, and hence, I <i>treasure these playing times and hold these memories close to my heart</i>. </p>
  <li><b>Rewarding</b></li>
  <p> Golf, like any other sport, requires discipline, to continually improve. I have spent numerous hours in the driving range to improve my skills. Even though I still cannot consistently hit a good golf shot, <i>the occasional results in good golf shots are extremely rewarding</i>.  </p>
  <li><b>Problem Solving</b></li>
  <p> A game of golf is similar to solving a series of challenges. Every shot will have its unique challenge due to the different terrain, distances, and environment. <i>I enjoy facing and solving these unpredictable challenges.</i></p>
  <li><b>Parallels with Life</b></li>
  <p> Perhaps, golf has a parallel with life. There is a start point (tee-off box), and an end point (hole). Even though one may be faced with numerous challenges in order to get to the end point, <i>if one perseveres, more often than not, one would get to the end</i>. Also, <i>ones result in a game of golf is usually predominantly dependent on oneself</i>. One competes with oneself in getting a better result, in hitting a better shot. In life, we fight our own unique battles, and we should not be overly competitive with other people. </p>
  <p> <i> Here is a picture of my Mum playing golf. Even though she is not a sporty person, and the guys in my family are relatively better players, she strives to improve her game by focusing on improving herself, rather than comparing with others. </i></p>
